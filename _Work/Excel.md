1. When download online Google sheet with multiple tabs, the only version to choose is xlsx which is excel. 

2. Note that on Google sheet, the tab of Google sheet does not have length limit, but in excel, the limit is 30 characters. So the tab name of downloaded version may cut a few characters in this case.
